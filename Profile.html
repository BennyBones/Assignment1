https://www.16personalities.com - Mediator</br>
The results of this personality test have me as a creative time. Some of my approaches may be impractical for a team to achieve but mediators are open minded and flexible. When forming a group it is important to have someone with a realistic and grounded idea of what needs to be done.</p>

As predominantly a visual learner I learn better with graphs and diagrams. While working with a group it is important for visual  learners to be able to see the information and communications from the team. Having a good communication tool, such as a messaging service or chat board, would help with team work.</p>

According to this learning styles test, I am both a Read/write and a Kinaesthetic learner. Read/write learn better with lists, graphs, notes and other print forms so having access to chat boards and messages would be beneficial in a group environment. Kinaesthetic learners learn best through practical exercises, examples, trial and error.</p>
